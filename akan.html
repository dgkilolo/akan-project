    <h2>What is an Akan Name?</h2>
    <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first names as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. The names are also gender specific; for example males born on Sunday are given the name Kwasi, while females born on Sunday are given the name Akosua.</p>
