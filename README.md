# Description
Most people know their birthdays but not many people know the actual day of the week when they were born. This website enable you to know which day you were born as well as knowing your Akan name by simply entering your birthday details and hitting submit! The idea of an Akan name originated from Ghanian culture. In the Ghanian culture children are given their first name as a day which corresponds to the day they were born. The names are also gender specific; for example, a male born on Sunday will be called 'Kwasi' while a female born on the same day will be called 'Akosua'.
